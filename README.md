# CyberGuard: AI-Powered Content Filtering Browser Extension

CyberGuard is an AI-powered browser extension designed to detect, flag, and rephrase harmful, offensive, or highly negative content in real-time as users browse the web. The extension aims to create a safer and more positive online experience by filtering out misinformation, offensive speech, and toxic content from platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and news sites.

## Project Overview

CyberGuard uses a combination of content detection algorithms, sentiment analysis, and AI-based rephrasing to transform negative online content into more neutral or positive alternatives. The extension offers users granular control over filtering sensitivity and features, allowing for a customized browsing experience.

### Key Features

- **Content Detection**: Identifies potentially harmful or offensive text on webpages
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of content to detect negative or harmful sentiment
- **Content Rephrasing**: Uses AI to transform negative content into more neutral or positive alternatives
- **Real-Time Scraping**: Continuously monitors page content as users browse
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows users to adjust sensitivity levels and enable/disable specific features
- **Protected Website Management**: Users can specify which websites should have content protection applied
- **Analysis Results History**: Keeps track of detected and rephrased content for user review

## Technical Architecture

The CyberGuard extension is built using a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based user interface with Chrome extension integration
- **Backend**: Express.js server with PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- **AI Models**: BERT-based model for sentiment analysis and BART-based model for content rephrasing

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL database:
   - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - Create a new database named `cyberguard`:
     ```bash
     psql -U postgres
     CREATE DATABASE cyberguard;
     \q
     ```
   - Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root:

## Testing with Real Websites

### Enabling the Extension

1. Click on the CyberGuard icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension popup
2. Ensure that the following settings are enabled:
   - Content Detection
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Content Rephrasing
   - Real-Time Scraping
3. Adjust sensitivity settings based on your preferences

### Testing Process

1. **Visit News Sites or Social Media**: Navigate to news websites or social media platforms that might contain negative content
   - Examples: Reddit, Twitter, news comment sections, forum discussions
   - Recommended test sites: news.ycombinator.com, reddit.com/r/politics, etc.

2. **Check Extension Badge**: The extension icon might change or display a badge with the number of detected content items

3. **View Analysis Results**: Click on the extension icon to see the list of detected content and how it was rephrased

4. **Testing Protected Websites**: You can add specific websites to your protected list to customize detection for those domains

5. **Testing with Different Sensitivity Levels**: 
   - Try adjusting the Content Sensitivity and Sentiment Sensitivity sliders in the Settings
   - Lower values will only catch very offensive content, while higher values will detect more subtle negative content

### Troubleshooting

If the extension isn't working as expected:

1. **Check Server Connection**:
   - Ensure the backend server is running
   - Check browser console for network errors (press F12, then go to Network tab)

2. **Extension Permissions**:
   - Make sure the extension has permissions to access website content
   - Click on "Details" for the CyberGuard extension in chrome://extensions/ and verify that "Site access" is set to "On all sites"

3. **Refresh Extension**:
   - If changes were made to the extension, click the refresh icon on the extension card in chrome://extensions/
   - You may need to reload web pages that were already open

4. **Reload Extension**:
   - In some cases, you might need to remove the extension and load it again:
     - Click "Remove" on the CyberGuard extension card
     - Click "Load unpacked" and select the client/public folder again
## Communication Between Extension and Backend

The CyberGuard extension communicates with the backend server in the following ways:

1. **Content Analysis**: When the extension detects potentially harmful content, it sends the text to the server for advanced sentiment analysis and rephrasing.

2. **Settings Synchronization**: User settings are stored in both the Chrome storage API and the PostgreSQL database for persistence across different devices.

3. **Protected Websites**: The list of protected websites and their specific protection settings are synchronized between the client and server.

4. **Analysis Results**: Results of content analysis are stored in the database and can be retrieved by the extension for display in the UI.

### API Endpoints

The server exposes the following main API endpoints:

- `POST /api/analyze/sentiment`: Analyzes the sentiment of provided text
- `POST /api/rephrase`: Rephrases negative content to be more positive or neutral
- Various endpoints for managing user settings, protected websites, and analysis results

### Testing the API

You can test the API endpoints using curl commands, for example:

```bash
# Test sentiment analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze/sentiment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I hate this website, it's terrible and useless", "threshold": 0.5}'

# Test content rephrasing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rephrase \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "This article is garbage and completely wrong", "type": "negative"}'
```
